            <p> As a Stevens student, I see the Hudson River almost every day. I've been told you can find dead bodies
                in it and that if you took a swim in it you'd grow an extra toe. But if that's true, why do the little 
                swimming ducks seem to be enjoying themselves so much?</p>
            
            <p> One day the water looked too nice to resist. It was late and dark, so there was no one around to judge 
                me. I went to the beach area at Maxwell Park and swam out. It was so refreshing! I floated on my back 
                and looked up at the city. It looked so beautiful, as did its reflection on the water.</p>
            
            <p> That's my secret. And I still haven't grown an extra toe!</p>
